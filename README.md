# Overview

In this Week01 Activity "Hello World" Module, I used HTML and CSS to create a Hello World webpage.

The purpose of creating this software is to demonstrate basic skills in HTML structure, page styling using CSS, and practicing good coding practices for web development. It also serves as a way to introduce myself in a creative format.
