        <p>Hello everyone! I'm Liezl Lizardo, 48 years old, single, and a member of Lucmayan Branch, Jordan Philippines District. I live on the Island of Guimaras, Philippines. I'm presently working at our local hospital here in our province for almost 6 years and spent 13 years at the Administrator's Office of the Provincial Government of Guimaras. I love sports like basketball, volleyball, and lately, soccer.</p>

        <p>One of the talks I love the most was given by Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin, titled <strong>"Come What May and Love It."</strong> He counseled us to learn to laugh, seek eternal truth, increase our compassion and understanding toward others, and trust in the Father and the Son. Thus, we should trust in the Lord, do our best, and leave the rest to Him.</p>
